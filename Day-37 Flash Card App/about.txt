### Explanation of the Code:

This Python script creates a flashcard application using the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and `pandas` for handling data stored in CSV files. The flashcards help users learn French words by displaying a French word for a few seconds, then showing the English translation.

#### Key Components and Functions:

1. **Imports and Constants**:
   - Import necessary libraries: `tkinter`, `pandas`, and `random`.
   - Define constants for background color and text colors.

2. **Global Variables**:
   - `to_learn`: Stores the list of words to learn.
   - `random_english`, `random_dic`, `timer`: Used within functions to manage the current word and timer.

3. **Functions**:
   - `next_card()`:
     - Reads words from CSV files.
     - Chooses a random French word from the list.
     - Updates the canvas to show the French word.
     - Sets a timer to call the `change()` function after 3 seconds.
   - `change()`:
     - Changes the card to display the English translation of the current French word.
   - `is_know()`:
     - Removes the current word from the list of words to learn if the user knows it.
     - Saves the updated list back to the CSV file.
     - Calls `next_card()` to display the next word.

4. **Main Application Window**:
   - Initializes the main application window with a title and background color.
   - Sets a timer to call the `change()` function after 3 seconds.
   - Creates a canvas to display the flashcards.
   - Adds buttons for marking a word as known or unknown, linking them to the appropriate functions.

5. **Canvas and Buttons**:
   - The canvas is used to display the flashcards with the French word initially and the English translation upon change.
   - Two buttons are created: one for indicating the word is known (`is_know()` function) and one for moving to the next word (`next_card()` function).

6. **Start the Application**:
   - Calls `next_card()` to display the first word.
   - Starts the `tkinter` main loop to keep the application running.

### How to Use This Application:

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have `tkinter`, `pandas`, and CSV files (`french_words.csv` and optionally `word_to_learn.csv`) in the same directory as the script.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to open the flashcard application.
3. **Learning Process**:
   - A French word is displayed first.
   - After 3 seconds, the card flips to show the English translation.
   - Use the buttons to mark if you know the word (it will be removed from the list) or if you need to review it again.
4. **CSV Files**:
   - `french_words.csv`: Contains the initial list of French words and their English translations.
   - `word_to_learn.csv`: Stores the list of words that need to be reviewed (updated dynamically based on user interaction).

This application helps users learn French vocabulary through repeated exposure and active recall using flashcards.
