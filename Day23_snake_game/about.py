"""This code sets up a classic Snake game using the Turtle graphics library in Python.
The game includes four main components: the snake, the food, the scoreboard, and the game screen.

main.py: This file initializes the game screen and controls the main game loop.
        It uses the Turtle library to display and update the game state, including handling user inputs for snake movement and
        detecting collisions with food, walls, and the snake's own body.

food.py: This file defines the Food class, which handles the creation and random placement of food items on the screen.
        It uses the Turtle class to create and manage food objects.

scoreboard.py: This file defines the Scoreboard class, which manages the game('s score display. '
                'It updates the score when the snake eats food and displays a game-over message when the game ends.)

snake.py: This file defines the Snake class, which manages the snake('s body segments and movement. '
            ('It handles adding new segments when the snake eats food, changing direction based on user input, and'
                ' detecting collisions with the walls and the snake'))s own body.

The main function in main.py uses a while loop to continuously update the game state and check for collisions, making it an interactive and
dynamic game experience."""
