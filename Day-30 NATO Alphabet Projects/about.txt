Code Description:

1. Purpose: This code converts a user-inputted word into its corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet code.
2. Key Functions: The code uses `pandas.read_csv` to read a CSV file containing the NATO phonetic alphabet and
constructs a dictionary using a dictionary comprehension. It then takes user input, converts it to uppercase,
and maps each letter to its corresponding phonetic code.

How the Code Works:

1. Data Importation: The code reads a CSV file (`nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv`) containing letters and their corresponding phonetic codes using the `pandas.read_csv` function.
2. Dictionary Creation: It creates a dictionary `word_code` where each letter is a key, and its corresponding phonetic code is the value.
3. User Input and Conversion: The user inputs a word, which is converted to uppercase. The code then translates each letter of the word into its phonetic code using the dictionary `word_code`.
4. Output: The phonetic codes are printed as a list.

This code provides a convenient way for users to convert any word into the NATO phonetic alphabet, useful for clear communication in various fields, such as aviation and military contexts.
