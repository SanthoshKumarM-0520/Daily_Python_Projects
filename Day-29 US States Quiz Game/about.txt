This code implements a U.S. States Quiz game using the Python turtle module and pandas library.
The code displays a map of the U.S. and prompts the user to guess the names of the states.
When the user inputs a state name correctly, the state is labeled on the map at the appropriate coordinates.
The game continues until all states are correctly guessed or the user types "exit".
The list of missed states is saved in a CSV file if the user exits before completing the quiz.

Key functions and features:

turtle.shape() and screen.addshape() are used to set the map image as the background.
pandas.read_csv() reads the state data and coordinates.
turtle.Turtle().write() is used to display the state names on the map.


To play the U.S. States Quiz game, follow these steps:

Start the Game:

Run the Python script. The game window will open with a map of the United States displayed.
Guessing States:

A dialog box will appear, prompting you to enter the name of a U.S. state. Type the state name and press Enter.
If your guess is correct, the state name will appear on the map at the correct location, and your score will increase by one.
Exiting the Game:

You can exit the game at any time by typing "exit" in the input dialog. This will end the game and save a list of the states you missed in a CSV file named "missed_states.csv".
Winning the Game:

The game continues until you have correctly named all 50 states. If you succeed, a congratulatory message will appear on the screen.
Additional Notes:
The game is case-insensitive, so you can type the state names in any case (e.g., "texas" or "Texas").
If you enter a state name that you've already guessed, it won't affect your score, and the game will continue.
The game uses coordinates from the "50_states.csv" file to position the state names on the map.
