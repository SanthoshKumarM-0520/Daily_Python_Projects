Here is a summary highlighting the additional features and improvements you have incorporated into the Tamil Nadu map project compared to the US map project:

US Map Code
https://github.com/SanthoshKumarM-0520/Daily_Python_Projects/tree/main/Day-29%20US%20States%20Quiz%20Game

CSV Data Handling: Reads data from a CSV file (50_states.csv).
State Guessing Mechanism: User guesses states by typing in the names.
Text Input: Utilizes screen.textinput for user input.
Dynamic State Display: States guessed correctly are displayed on the map at corresponding coordinates.
Score Tracking: Tracks the number of correctly guessed states.
Exit Option: User can exit the game, which then saves missed states to a CSV file.
Completion Message: Displays a congratulatory message when all states are guessed correctly.


Tamil Nadu Map Code

JSON Data Handling: Uses JSON files (Disxy.json, to_learn.json, score.txt) for storing coordinates, remaining districts, and scores.
Interactive Coordinate Capture: (Commented Out) Function to capture coordinates by clicking on the map.
Enhanced District Guessing Mechanism: User guesses districts by typing in names.
Persistent State Tracking:
Score Tracking: Reads and writes the score to a text file.
Remaining Districts Tracking: Reads and updates the remaining districts in a JSON file.
Text Input: Utilizes screen.textinput for user input with enhanced capitalization (title()).
Dynamic District Display: Districts guessed correctly are displayed on the map at corresponding coordinates using data from JSON.
Exit Option: Allows the user to exit the game and saves progress in JSON files.
Completion Message: Displays a congratulatory message when all districts are guessed correctly.
Error Handling: Implements try-except blocks for handling file read/write errors and non-existent files.
Improvements and New Topics Practiced in Tamil Nadu Map Code
JSON File Handling: Introduction of JSON for data persistence, allowing for more complex data structures and easier data manipulation.
Interactive Coordinate Capture: (Although commented out) Shows an attempt to use mouse clicks to dynamically capture and store coordinates, demonstrating advanced interactivity.
Persistent Storage: Implements a more robust system for storing and retrieving game progress across sessions (using to_learn.json and score.txt).
Enhanced User Input Handling: Utilizes the title() method to standardize user input, improving user experience.
Enhanced Error Handling: Comprehensive use of try-except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully, ensuring smoother execution and user experience.
These enhancements demonstrate a deeper understanding of Python programming, especially in areas such as data persistence, error handling, and user interaction.
This progression showcases your growing expertise and ability to handle more complex programming challenges.
